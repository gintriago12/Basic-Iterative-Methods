# Basic-Iterative-Methods
Iterative algorithms and their explicit forms to solve linear systems of the form _Ax=b_ where _A_ is a square matrix of _R^nxn_, x and b vectors of _R^nx1_. The algorithms are Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR.

The code is written in Python inside a jupyter notebook. Download the file _Basic Iterative Methods.ipynb_ and run it in your PC or in jupyter online.

## Motivation
I wanted to put the main iterative methods to solve linear systems with their explicit form in one place. We hope this notebook helps undergrads and graduate students.

## Contributors
Thanks to Dr. Pedro Merino for providing the theoretical resources and guidance to code the algorithms in Python.
